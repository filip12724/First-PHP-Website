Description: My first PHP project! A simple web application with features like an admin panel, user management, and custom database queries.

⚠️ Disclaimer
This was my first PHP project, built while learning the basics of web development. I’m aware that:

The file structure doesn’t follow MVC or modern architectural patterns.

Code reusability and separation of concerns could be improved.

There might be "hacky" workarounds or inefficiencies.

I’ve kept it here as a learning milestone to track my growth. Feedback and suggestions are welcome!

🔑 Key Features
Despite its flaws, this project includes:

A functional admin panel with user/data management.

Complex SQL queries for dynamic content.

Basic authentication and session handling.

📖 What I Learned

PHP fundamentals (syntax, forms, sessions).

Connecting PHP to MySQL databases.

Security basics (protection against SQL injection, password hashing).

The importance of planning architecture early (MVC, reusable code).
